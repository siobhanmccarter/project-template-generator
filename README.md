# A project template generator

### This script, `cookie.sh`, will create basic directories and files needed for any project.


**What it does**: This script will create two markdown files, README and LICENSE, plus 5 directories. README is to be used to describe the aim of your project and to provide an overview of your work/processes. The LICENSE is the basic licensing for your project. The `data` directory is where you would store all raw data and metadata that you use in your project. The `doc` directory is for any text documents that are relevant to your project. The `results` directory is to show any intermediate steps plus your outputs from your analysis, including figures, cleaned data, and so on. The `src` directory is for the project source code. Lastly, the `misc` directory is for all bits that perhaps don't fit in any of the other directories. 

**How to use it**: This code is to be run in the shell. The first step is to ensure your working directory is the file in which you will be making your project. Then, using `bash`, run the `cookie.sh` script in the shell to create all the files listed above.
